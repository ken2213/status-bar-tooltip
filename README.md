# STATUS BAR TOOLTIP

If you hover on an anchor link, what do you see?

A link at the bottom right or left of the webpage right?

That's what I am, a Status Bar Tooltip!!!!

## A Message for Occasional "Anchor Tag Haters" Out There

If you're an anchor tag hater use me!

Ever encountered this?
```
<ul>

  <li>
      <a>Link 1</a>
  </li>
  <li>
      <a>Link 2</a>
  </li>
  <li>
      <a>Link 3</a>
  </li>

</ul>
```

The problem here is that, only the anchor tag text is being functional and not the whole <li> tag
