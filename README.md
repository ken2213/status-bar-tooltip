# STATUS BAR TOOLTIP

If you hover on an anchor link, what do you see?

A link at the bottom right or left of the webpage right?

That's what I am, a Status Bar Tooltip!!!!

## A Message for Occasional "Anchor Tag Haters" Out There

If you're an anchor tag hater use me!

Ever encountered this?
```
<ul>

  <li>
      <a>Link 1</a>
  </li>
  <li>
      <a>Link 2</a>
  </li>
  <li>
      <a>Link 3</a>
  </li>

</ul>
```

The problem here is that, only the anchor tag text is being functional and not the whole list tag

Now, if you're brave enough to semantically make errors with your html file others do this
```
<ul>

  <a>
    <li>Link 1</li>
  </a>

  <a>
    <li>Link 1</li>
  </a>

  <a>
    <li>Link 1</li>
  </a>

</ul>
```

You can't either put a href attribute to list tag, that's what anchor tag job is...

Try to look at the code or the live preview for you to have an idea
